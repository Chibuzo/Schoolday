        <h3>Welcome to Schooldays GitHub pages.</h3>

<p>This, for now, is the working environment for Schooldays developers. All progress and recent modification can be seen here. Thank you for coming around.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If wish to host any developed app that has to do with education, or intends to develop an an app that supports learning, and you want it to be on Schooldays, feel free to contact us.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Schooldays developers: Chibuzo, Modulus and Iroegbu.</p>
